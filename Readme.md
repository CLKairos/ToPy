# ToPy or Not ToPy
No seriously this is a CLI (Command Line Interface) based python program that helps you manage your tasks.

If you have any suggestions let me know and I will do my best to implement them.

---
# Get Started with ToPy
## Linux
Download the 'script.py' file in the repo above. (The txt files are optional, if they aren't there the script will make them automatically)

Next run the code below
```
python3 script.py
```

This should start the program, but if it doesn't then you probably need to install Python

For Automatic Installation we Recommend PyEnv
```
curl -fsSL https://pyenv.run | bash
```
Feel free to use any other installation method, as all should work.

## Windows
Get fucked, I'm not doing a tutorial for windows.
Do it yourself.
